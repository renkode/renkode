<h3>â˜• Hey there, call me Ren (or Renko)!</h3>

Frontend developer, dark mode dweller, and UI/UX enthusiast, I'm a freelance illustrator who stumbled into web development and was surprised to learn that I enjoy it, almost too much. Now I aspire to collaborate on products and contribute to open-source projects that will have a meaningful impact.

Check out my latest project, [Zardle](https://zardle.pages.dev/)!

- Primarily using ES6+/Typescript/React/Sass
- Interested in learning UI/UX design, Vue.js, and CSS libraries/frameworks
- Pronouns: she/her
- Also doing game development as a hobby and wish to bring my original ideas to life!
