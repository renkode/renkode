<h3>â˜• Hey there, call me Ren!</h3>

I'm an illustrator and frontend developer who likes jigsaw puzzles. Also doing game development as a hobby and hope to bring my original ideas to life.

Check out my latest projects, [Chitter](https://chitterapp.netlify.app/home) and [Zardle](https://zardle.pages.dev/)!

- Primarily using ES6+/Typescript/React/Vue/SCSS
